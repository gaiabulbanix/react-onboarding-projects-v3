# React Onboarding Roadmap (v1.4.1 — 2025-11-09)
**Developer:** Gorby  
**Assistant Codename:** Bob  
**Date:** November 9, 2025  
**Change Summary:** Updated to align with roadmap v1.5.1 — incorporating the structured transition from CRA → Vite/Tailwind → MERN (Dungeon Dash).

---

## 🧭 Context Update
While the original v1.4 roadmap focused solely on the **CRA environment**, version 1.4.1 now acknowledges the evolving architecture of Gorby’s broader roadmap (v1.5.1). This includes future-proofing React onboarding to facilitate easier migration into Vite and Tailwind, and introducing awareness of the Dungeon Dash MERN project as the long-term integration goal.

## ⚙️ Adjusted Learning Flow Structure

| Phase | Type | Core Focus | Deliverable |
|-------|------|-------------|--------------|
| **R0** | Setup | CRA setup, boilerplate cleanup, repo hygiene | Stable CRA environment |
| **R1–R2** | Mini Projects | JSX, props, state, event handling | GreetingHub, Counter Tracker |
| **R3** | Mini Project | useEffect, lifecycle, persistence | LocalStorage Tracker |
| **R4** | Mini Project | Controlled inputs, lifting state | Task Manager |
| **R5** | Synthesis Project | State + effects + composition → cohesive UI | Skill Tracker Dashboard |
| **R6** | Integration Phase | Combine all components into Dashboard MVP | React Dev Dashboard (CRA) |
| **R7 (New)** | Transition | Environment migration & styling fluency | Vite + Tailwind setup & refactor |

---

## 🧩 Added Notes for Phase R7
**Objective:** Transition from CRA to Vite/Tailwind post-MVP completion.  
**Purpose:** Reinforce environment setup skills, modernize styling workflow, and prepare for future MERN stack integration (Dungeon Dash).  
**Outcome:** Rebuilt or refactored Dashboard with cleaner, faster architecture.

---

## 🧠 Forward Integration Reference
After Phase R7, progress naturally into:
- **Dungeon Dash (MERN)** — full-stack project integration using learned React/Vite foundations.  
- **Portfolio Polish** — showcase React + MERN expertise.
