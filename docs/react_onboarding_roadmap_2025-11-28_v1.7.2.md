# React Onboarding Roadmap v1.7.2
Date: 2025-12-15

## R9 — UI Scaffolding & Composition (Completed)
### Outcomes
- Built reusable UI primitives
- Practiced component composition
- Strengthened visual & structural intuition

### Note for Future R#
⚠️ State Lifting & Shared State
A real-world edge case was encountered when lifting Toggle state.
This topic should be revisited later via:
- a focused mini-project
- reduced UI complexity
- explicit goal of understanding render lifecycles

Do NOT revisit prematurely.

## R10 (Preview)
- Light integration
- Optional routing concepts
- No global state yet
