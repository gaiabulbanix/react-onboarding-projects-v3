# R10 — UI Flows

Purpose:
This branch is dedicated to React R10 work, focusing on:
- UI composition
- Component flow
- Scaffold reuse from R9
- Confidence through repetition

Constraints:
- No global/shared state
- No premature abstraction
- No backend unless explicitly introduced
- This is a sandbox, not a portfolio project

Status:
R10 in progress.
