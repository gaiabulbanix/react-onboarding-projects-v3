# R11 — Next Focus (Draft)

Goals:
- Apply React patterns in small, real-feeling projects
- Keep state simple and local unless forced otherwise
- Continue avoiding premature abstraction
- Prioritize confidence and consistency over speed

Notes:
- R9 and R10 successfully stabilized UI flow and state intuition
- Next work should feel like “using React”, not “learning React”
